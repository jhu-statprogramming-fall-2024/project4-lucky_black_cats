This is the repository for our final project.
These are the files used to create the app, but quarto files only support static files
Therefore, the app was deployed locally and is available on: https://mabj4815.shinyapps.io/project4/

We are using the free version of shinyapps, and therefore are limited to 25 hours a week.
This means that we turn off the app when not in use.

If you are a TA trying to grade this and it is off, please contact admind at abandal1@jh.edu
