This is the repository for our final project.

Our project correlates Wikipedia page hits with stock prizes, and tries to predict the movement of the stock on ther following days.
We have built our app on RShiny. The quarto file presented here presents the pre-app work (trainind, testing, and cross-validating the data),
as well as the user interface and server.


However, we have a local version of the server and UI code actually running for the hosting process
Therefore, the app was deployed locally and is available on: https://mabj4815.shinyapps.io/project4/

We are using the free version of shinyapps, and therefore are limited to 25 hours a week.
This means that we turn off the app when not in use.

If you are a TA trying to grade this and it is off, please contact admin at abandal1@jh.edu

## App instructions:

### Select a Wikipedia Page. It should be typed as the final part of a Wiki site
For example, the Wikipedia page for the U.S.A is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States,
and therefore United_States should be used in the Wiki field

### Select a stock ticker. For example, AAPL for Apple, or TSLA for TSLA

### Select dates. We reccomend using at least 3 months of data for better outcomes
